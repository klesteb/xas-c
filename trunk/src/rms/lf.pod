=head1 NAME

lf - A class for manipulating files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <stdio.h>
 #include "xas/rms/lf.h"

 int main(int argc, char **argv) {

     lf_t *temp = NULL;
     char *filename = "files.pod";
     
     if ((temp = lf_create(filename))) {

         lf_open(temp, O_RDONLY, 0);
         lf_close(temp);

         lf_destroy(temp);

     }

     return 0;

 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a class to perform file I/O. It reads a file a line at a time.
Where the line uses a termination sequence such as a line feed(LF). It uses 
standard Unix file I/O to perform its functions.

The files lf.c and lf.h define the class. 

=over 4

=item B<xas/rms/lf.h>

This defines the interface to the class. 

=item B<lf.c> 

This implements the interface.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 I<lf_t *lf_create(char *filename, int retries, int timeout)>

This method initializes the class. 

=over 4

=item B<filename>

The name of the file to manipulate.

=back

=head2 I<int lf_destroy(lf_t *self)>

This destroys the object. 

=over 4

=item B<self>

A pointer to a lf_t object.

=back

=head2 I<int lf_override(lf_t *self, item_list_t *items)>

This method allows you to override methods. 

=over 4

=item B<self>

A pointer to a lf_t object.

=item B<items>

An array of item_list_t types. The array is 0 terminated.

=back

=head2 I<int lf_compare(lf_t *this, lf_t *that)>

This method allows you to compare one lf_t object to another. 

=over 4

=item B<this>

A pointer to a lf_t object.

=item B<that>

A pointer to a lf_t object.

=back

=head2 I<char *lf_version(lf_t *self)>

This method returns the version of the library. The version number
follows the guidelines from L<semver.org|https://semver.org/>.

=over 4

=item B<self>

A pointer to the lf_t object.

=back

=head2 I<int lf_open(lf_t *self, int flags, mode_t mode)>

This method allows you to open the file. This is a wrapper around
L<open(2)>.

=over 4

=item B<self>

A pointer for a lf_t object.

=item B<flags>

The flags to pass to open().

=item B<mode>

The mode to pass to open().

=back

=head2 I<int lf_close(lf_t *self)>

This method allows you to close the file. This is a wrapper around
L<close(2)>.

=over 4

=item B<self>

A pointer for a lf_t object.

=back

=head2 I<int lf_puts(lf_t *self, char *buffer, size_t size, ssize_t *count)>

This method allows you to write a string to the file. The string will have a
"\n" appended to the end. This is an emulation of L<puts(3)>.

=over 4

=item B<self>

A pointer to a lf_t object.

=item B<buffer>

A pointer to the buffer to write to the file.

=item B<size>

The size of the buffer.

=item B<count>

A pointer to the number of bytes written. A 0 indicates that nothing
was written.

=back

=head2 I<int lf_gets(lf_t *self, char *buffer, size_t size, ssize_t *count)>

This method allows you to read a string from a file. The read will be up to 
I<size> number of characters, EOF or when a '\n' has been reached. The string 
will have a '\0' appended to the end. This is an emulation of L<gets(3)>.

=over 4

=item B<self>

A pointer to a lf_t object.

=item B<buffer>

A pointer to the buffer read from the file.

=item B<size>

The size of the buffer.

=item B<count>

A pointer to the number of bytes read. 0 bytes would indicate end of
file. This may also indicate that your process dosen't have access to 
the file.

=back

=head2 I<int lf_exists(lf_t *self, int *exists)>

This method allows you to check and see if a files exists. This is a
wrapper around L<stat(2)>.

=over 4

=item B<self>

A pointer to a lf_t object.

=item B<exists>

A pointer to wither the file exists. This is a TRUE/FALSE value.

=back

=head2 I<int lf_stat(lf_t *self, struct stat *buffer)>

This method allows you to retrieve file information. This is a wrapper around 
L<stat(2)>.

=over 4

=item B<self>

A pointer to a lf_t object.

=item B<buffer>

A pointer to a I<struct stat> data structure.

=back

=head2 I<int lf_unlink(lf_t *self)>

This method allows you to unlink a file. This is a wrapper around 
L<unlink(2)>.

=over 4

=item B<self>

A pointer to a lf_t object.

=back

=head2 I<int lf_size(lf_t *self, off_t *size)>

This method allows you to retrieve the file size. This is a wrapper around 
L<stat(2)>.

=over 4

=item B<self>

A pointer to a lf_t object.

=item B<size>

A pointer to where to write the file size.

=back

=head1 MUTATORS

=head2 I<int lf_get_fd(lf_t *self, int *fd)>

This method returns the file descriptor.

=over 4

=item B<self>

A pointer to a lf_t object.

=item B<fd>

A pointer to store the file descriptor into.

=back

=head2 I<int lf_get_eol(lf_t *self, char *eol)>

This method returns the current end of line.

=over 4

=item B<self>

A pointer to a lf_t object.

=item B<eol>

A pointer to store the end of line into.

=back

=head2 I<int lf_set_eol(lf_t *self, char *eol)>

This method sets the current end of line.

=over 4

=item B<self>

A pointer to a lf_t object.

=item B<eol>

A pointer to the new end of line.

=back

=head1 RETURNS

The method lf_create() returns a pointer to a lf_t object. All other 
methods return either OK on success or ERR on failure. The extended 
error description can be returned with object_get_error().
