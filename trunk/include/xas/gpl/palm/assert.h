    assert.h

    Standard C Assertions.

    NOTE: This is a very simple "assert.h" file for building PalmOS software
    with PRC-TOOLS.  (I needed it for compiling BSD-XDR's "xdr_rec.c".)  If
    the assertion fails, an error message is written to standard error, which
    is probably not very useful on a Palm Pilot.

    If C Preprocessor symbol NDEBUG is defined, the assertion is factored out
    of the source code with an empty assert() macro.  Because the standard
    requires that "assert.h" can be #include'd multiple times in a source
    file, with NDEBUG #define'd or #undef'ed before each inclusion, there
    is no #if preventing the header file from being processed more than once.
    [The assert() "function" is always defined as a macro.  More full-featured
    "assert.h" files will have guards around declarations of functions, etc.
    referenced in the macro, but not around the actual definition of the macro.]

    For my own convenience, the assertion is disabled if either NDEBUG is
    defined or if HAVE_ASSERT is defined with a value of 0.
